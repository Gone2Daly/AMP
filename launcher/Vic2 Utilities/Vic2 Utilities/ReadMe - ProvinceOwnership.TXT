This utility works by drag-and-dropping province files on it (dragging multiple files at once works). The utility will then apply on those files the modifications configured.

"Change owner" and "change controller" switch the owner and controller respectively to the country given as "new TAG".
"Add core" adds a core for the "New TAG" value if it is not already there.
"Remove core" removes the indicated core, if it is there.
"Empty province" removes the owner & controller tags (i.e., makes the province unoccupied).
"Colonial status" sets whether the province is considered colonial or not.
